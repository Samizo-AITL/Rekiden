---

### Chapter II: The Battle of Yamazaki (June 13, 1582)
- A decisive confrontation near Mount Tennōzan.  
- If Hideyoshi wins → moves to consolidate power at the **Council of Kiyosu**.

---

### Chapter III: The Council of Kiyosu (July 1582)
- Succession crisis over Nobunaga’s heirs: **Sanbōshi (Nobutada’s infant son), Nobukatsu, or Nobutaka**.  
- Hideyoshi pushes for Sanbōshi under his guardianship.  
- Shibata supports Nobutaka.

---

### Chapter IV: The Battle of Shizugatake (1583)
