# 🏃‍♂️ 1582: The Great Return from Chūgoku — Heir to Nobunaga

---

## 📘 Scenario Background

In June 1582, **Hashiba Hideyoshi** (later known as Toyotomi Hideyoshi) was laying siege to **Takamatsu Castle** in Bitchū Province as part of the Chūgoku campaign against the Mōri clan.

Suddenly, a shocking report arrived —  
**Oda Nobunaga had been killed at Honnō-ji in Kyoto by Akechi Mitsuhide.**

Hideyoshi immediately negotiated a ceasefire with the Mōri and began a lightning-fast march back east.  
Covering more than 200 kilometers in less than 10 days, this maneuver — known as the "**Great Return from Chūgoku**" — became one of the most legendary tactical withdrawals in Japanese history.

Now, the final confrontation with Akechi Mitsuhide looms.  
Your swift decisions will determine the fate of the realm.
