# ⚔️ Battle of Nagashino, 1575  
_Rekiden Scenario Template (English Version)_

---

## 📘 Scenario Background

In 1575, Takeda Katsuyori laid siege to Nagashino Castle.  
In response, Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu mobilized a massive force of 38,000 troops and entrenched themselves in the plains of Shitaragahara.

Nobunaga deployed 3,000 matchlock gunners in a triple-line formation to repel Takeda’s renowned cavalry.  
The Takeda army suffered a crushing defeat, losing most of its elite commanders—including Yamagata Masakage and Baba Nobuharu.

But what if the legendary strategist **Yamamoto Kansuke** had lived to advise Katsuyori at Nagashino?  
The outcome might have been dramatically different.
