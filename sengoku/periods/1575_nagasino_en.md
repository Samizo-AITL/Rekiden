📝 Play Log: Battle of Nagashino (Takeda Katsuyori)

🎮 Player Information
	•	Player Name: your_name_here
	•	Faction: Takeda Clan (Takeda Katsuyori)
	•	Initial Base: Around Nagashino Castle
	•	Commanders: Yamagata Masakage, Baba Nobuharu, Naitō Masahide, Obata Nobusada
	•	Strategist Option: 🧠 Yamamoto Kansuke (Strategic Analysis & Tactical Planning)
	•	Initial Troop Strength: 15,000 soldiers

📘 Scenario Information
	•	Title: Battle of Nagashino
	•	Year: 1575
	•	Initial Situation: Nagashino Castle is under siege. The enemy is gathering forces in Shitaragahara.
	•	Enemy Forces: Oda–Tokugawa Alliance (38,000 troops)

🔍 Enemy Analysis (by Strategist Yamamoto Kansuke)
	•	The enemy has built a defensive formation centered on firearms. Its firepower is formidable but relies heavily on visibility and weather conditions.
	•	Their formation—triple-line volley fire behind wooden palisades on flat terrain—is highly effective against frontal cavalry assaults.
	•	However, it is vulnerable to smoke, rain, and flanking maneuvers, and their counterattack capacity weakens if their formation collapses.
	•	Disrupting the enemy’s supply line (Shitaragahara to Okazaki) could trigger a breakdown in their war front.

🛡 Countermeasures (Kansuke’s Five Tactics)
	1.	Night Raid with Smoke: Use smoke to obscure enemy vision at night, causing confusion in firearm ranks.
	2.	Baited Volley: Send out small decoy units to lure out gunfire, exhausting their ammunition.
	3.	Flanking Assault: Use forest or riverside routes to attack the sides or rear of the palisade line.
	4.	Rain-Timed Charge: Launch an assault during rain—matchlock guns become unreliable when wet.
	5.	Supply Line Disruption: Use Obata Nobusada to sabotage enemy logistics and cause internal disarray.

🎯 Initial Choices

Select one (✅)

	•	Deploy the cavalry and break through the enemy at Shitaragahara (Direct Assault)
　→ Take the initiative with a frontal charge. Success depends on attacking before the enemy’s gun line is fully established.
	•	Maintain the siege and cautiously observe enemy movements (War of Attrition)
　→ Focus on continuing the siege of Nagashino Castle. Offers strategic flexibility, but risks letting the enemy strengthen.
	•	🧠 Follow Yamamoto Kansuke’s plan and execute a surprise maneuver to neutralize the gun line
　→ A multi-layered tactic using nighttime smoke screens, flanking attacks, and logistics disruption.
　→ Aim to dismantle the enemy formation and seize the battlefield momentum.
