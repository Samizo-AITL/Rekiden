# ⚔️ Battle of Kawanakajima (1561) – Scenario

---

## 📘 Background

In 1561, the struggle for dominance in Shinano Province culminated in the legendary clash between **Takeda Shingen** of Kai and **Uesugi Kenshin** of Echigo.  
This battle, known as the **Fifth Battle of Kawanakajima**, became one of the most iconic and bloodiest engagements of the Sengoku period.

The two armies confronted each other in the Kawanakajima plain (Nagano Basin). Shingen aimed to outmaneuver Kenshin using the **Woodpecker Strategy (Kitsutsuki Sakusen)**, while Kenshin countered with the **Kuruma-gakari no Jin (Winding Wheel Formation)**, a unique rotating assault formation.  

These opposing strategies clashed in a chaotic and intense battle that would be remembered as one of Japan’s greatest tactical confrontations.

## ⚔️ Tactical Concepts

### 🟨 Woodpecker Strategy (Kitsutsuki Sakusen – 武田信玄)
A complex plan where one force lures the enemy into engagement while a second detachment attacks the enemy’s rear, like a woodpecker striking a tree.  
Shingen intended to divide his forces, with one attacking at night and the other ambushing Kenshin’s camp at dawn.

### 🟩 Kuruma-gakari no Jin (車懸かりの陣 – 上杉謙信)
A rotating wheel formation where successive units continuously attack the enemy front.  
This constant pressure prevents the opponent from resting, overwhelming them with relentless assaults.  
Kenshin personally led charges, creating legendary moments such as his direct assault on Shingen’s command tent.
