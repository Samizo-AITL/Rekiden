# 🏯 Three-Country Alliance (1555) – Scenario

In 1555, Shingen Takeda of Kai, Yoshimoto Imagawa of Suruga, and Ujiyasu Hojo of Sagami formed an alliance,  
known as the **Kai–Suruga–Sagami Three-Country Alliance (Kōsōsun Sangoku Dōmei)**.  

This drastically changed the balance of power in eastern Japan, heightening tensions with the Oda clan in Owari,  
the Uesugi clan in Echigo, and various Kanto powers.  
The player chooses one of the factions and, through diplomacy, war, and internal policy,  
experiences the history of maintaining, expanding, or collapsing the alliance.

---

## 📘 Scenario Background

- **Origin**: The Takeda, Imagawa, and Hojo were all expanding their territories, and border conflicts were constant.  
  → A marriage alliance was arranged, establishing a pact of non-aggression and mutual military cooperation.  
- **Challenges**: In Shinano and Echigo, Nagao Kagetora (later known as Uesugi Kenshin) was rising in power; in Kanto, Kanrei Uesugi Norimasa and allied lords opposed Hojo dominance.  
- **Prospects**: If the alliance is maintained, stability may come to the east. If interests clash, however, collapse is inevitable.

👉 Diplomacy or War? The player’s choices will shape history.

## 🧭 Victory Conditions

- **Takeda Clan**: Secure control of Shinano and suppress the Uesugi of Echigo.  
- **Imagawa Clan**: Dominate the Tōkaidō region and check the Oda.  
- **Hojo Clan**: Consolidate Kanto and drive out Uesugi influence.  
- **Uesugi Clan**: Expand into Shinano and Kanto, and divide the alliance.  

※ Each clan has unique victory conditions achievable through diplomacy, warfare, or domestic policy.
