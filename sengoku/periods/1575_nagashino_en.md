# ⚔️ Battle of Nagashino (1575)  
_Rekiden Scenario Template (Kansuke Special)_

---

## 📘 Scenario Background

In 1575, **Takeda Katsuyori** laid siege to Nagashino Castle.  
**Oda Nobunaga** and **Tokugawa Ieyasu**, leading a coalition army of about 38,000 men, advanced to Shitaragahara to confront him.

Nobunaga deployed **3,000 arquebusiers** in a three-line volley fire formation behind wooden palisades, effectively stopping the famous Takeda cavalry charge.  
The Takeda army suffered a devastating defeat, losing many veteran commanders including **Yamagata Masakage** and **Baba Nobuharu**.  
Historically, this marked the decline of the Takeda clan.  

⚡ But what if the famed strategist **Yamamoto Kansuke** had survived until this battle?  
Could his cunning turn the tide against Oda’s guns? This scenario explores that alternate history.

- Initial State: Nagashino under siege, Oda–Tokugawa forces entrenched nearby
- Enemy: Oda–Tokugawa Alliance (38,000 men)

🔍 Enemy Analysis (by Kansuke)
- Oda relies on arquebusiers protected by palisades: powerful firepower, but dependent on visibility and weather.
- Their triple volley system ensures continuous fire, but consumes ammunition rapidly.
- Weaknesses: poor mobility, vulnerable to flanking attacks, reduced firepower in heavy rain or smoke.

🛡 Kansuke’s Five Stratagems
1. **Night Raid with Smoke**: Use fire and smoke to blind arquebusiers and create chaos at night.  
2. **Bullet Wasting Tactics**: Send small units to provoke gunfire and drain enemy ammunition.  
3. **Flank Attack**: Maneuver cavalry through forests or riversides to hit their flanks.  
4. **Rain Assault**: Time an attack during rain, when matchlocks misfire.  
5. **Supply Line Disruption**: Send detachments to cut the enemy’s supply route from Okazaki.  

🎯 Initial Choices
- [ ] Order a massive cavalry charge against Shitaragahara (Direct Assault)  
- [ ] Maintain the siege and wait for an opportunity (Attrition Strategy)  
- [ ] Follow Kansuke’s plan and launch an unconventional strike to neutralize the arquebusiers (Kansuke Special)
