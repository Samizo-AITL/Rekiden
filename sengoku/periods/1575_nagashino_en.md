# ⚔️ Battle of Nagashino, 1575  
_Rekiden Scenario Template (English Version)_

---

## 📘 Scenario Background

In 1575, Takeda Katsuyori laid siege to Nagashino Castle.  
In response, Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu mobilized a massive force of 38,000 troops and entrenched themselves in the plains of Shitaragahara.

Nobunaga deployed 3,000 matchlock gunners in a triple-line formation to repel Takeda’s renowned cavalry.  
The Takeda army suffered a crushing defeat, losing most of its elite commanders—including Yamagata Masakage and Baba Nobuharu.

But what if the legendary strategist **Yamamoto Kansuke** had lived to advise Katsuyori at Nagashino?  
The outcome might have been dramatically different.

## 🎮 Player Info

- **Player Name**: your_name_here  
- **Faction**: Takeda Clan (Takeda Katsuyori)  
- **Starting Location**: Near Nagashino Castle  
- **Officers**: Yamagata Masakage, Baba Nobuharu, Naitō Masahide, Obata Nobusada  
- **Strategist (Optional)**: 🧠 Yamamoto Kansuke (Strategic Planning & Deception)  
- **Troop Strength**: 15,000  

## 📘 Scenario Info

- **Title**: Battle of Nagashino  
- **Year**: 1575  
- **Initial State**: Besieging Nagashino Castle. Enemy troops are gathering at Shitaragahara.  
- **Enemy Force**: Oda–Tokugawa Alliance (38,000 troops)  

## 🔍 Enemy Analysis (by Yamamoto Kansuke)

- The enemy’s defense relies heavily on firearms. Their firepower is immense but highly dependent on weather and visibility.  
- Their triple-line formation behind palisades is extremely dangerous for frontal cavalry charges.  
- However, the formation is vulnerable to **smoke, rain, and flanking**, and their morale drops if the line collapses.  
- Severing their **supply route from Shitaragahara to Okazaki** may destabilize their entire war front.  

## 🛡 Kansuke’s Five Countermeasures

1. **Smoke-covered Night Raid**  
   → Obscure vision and create chaos among gunners.  
2. **Baited Volley**  
   → Send decoys to draw enemy fire and exhaust ammunition.  
3. **Flanking Maneuver**  
   → Attack from forest or riverside routes.  
4. **Rain Assault**  
   → Firearms misfire during rain—ideal for a cavalry charge.  
5. **Logistics Disruption**  
   → Send Obata Nobusada to harass and cut off supplies.  

## 🎯 Initial Choices

> Choose one strategy to begin:

- [ ] **Send cavalry for a frontal breakthrough at Shitaragahara** *(Direct Assault)*  
　→ Bold but risky. Success depends on breaking the gunline before it fully stabilizes.

- [ ] **Maintain the siege and wait to observe enemy movements** *(Attrition Strategy)*  
　→ A cautious approach, focusing on prolonged siege and reactionary moves.

- [ ] **🧠 Execute Kansuke’s multi-phase plan to neutralize the gunline** *(Surprise Maneuver)*  
　→ Combines smoke, night raid, flanking, and logistics disruption. High risk, high reward.
