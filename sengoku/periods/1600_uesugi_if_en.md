# 🏯 1600: Righteous Rule — Rise of Heaven, Earth, and Man

---

## 📘 Scenario Background

In the 5th year of Keichō (1600), Tokugawa Ieyasu declared a punitive expedition against Uesugi Kagekatsu.  
In response, Kagekatsu rose in defiance.

His retainer, Naoe Kanetsugu, sent a provocative letter—the infamous **"Naoe Letter"**—denouncing Tokugawa’s tyranny.  
It marked the beginning of a new path in an alternate Sengoku history.

Uesugi seizes control of the north, seeking alliances with Sanada, Mōri, and Shimazu to encircle Tokugawa.  
Ultimately, he aims to establish the **Uesugi Shogunate** with the approval of the Imperial Court.

With **Heaven (destiny)**, **Earth (territory)**, and **People (loyalty)** on his side, a new righteous order begins to rise.
