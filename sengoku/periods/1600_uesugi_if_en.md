# 🏯 1600 – Righteous Rule: Rise of Tenchijin

## 📘 Scenario Background

In Keichō 5 (1600) —  
Upon receiving Tokugawa Ieyasu’s declaration of the "Aizu Campaign," **Uesugi Kagekatsu** finally rises.

The *Naoe Letter*, sent by **Naoe Kanetsugu** to Ieyasu,  
serves as both a challenge and a declaration of justice against Tokugawa tyranny.

This bold decision sets the stage for an alternate history at the end of the Sengoku period.  
With control over the Tōhoku region, the Uesugi ally with the Sanada, Mōri, and Shimazu clans  
to encircle Tokugawa forces. Their aim: the establishment of a **Uesugi Shogunate**,  
recognized by the Imperial Court.

With Heaven (Ten), Earth (Chi), and People (Jin) on their side,  
a new era of righteous rule begins.
