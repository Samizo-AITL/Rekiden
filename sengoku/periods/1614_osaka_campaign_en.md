# 🏯 1614: Siege of Osaka — The Last Battle of the Toyotomi

---

## 📘 Scenario Background

After stepping down as Shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu continued to wield power behind the scenes.  
Eventually, he raised his army under the banner of eliminating the Toyotomi clan once and for all.

The target: Toyotomi Hideyori and his loyal retainers, entrenched within mighty **Osaka Castle**.  
In response, the Toyotomi side gathers rōnin from across the land and resolves to resist.

A modern-style fortress — **Sanada-maru** — is constructed on the southern flank,  
turning the stronghold into more than just a site of defense.

This is not merely a siege.  
This is the final blaze of the Sengoku era — the last chance for the Toyotomi to survive.
