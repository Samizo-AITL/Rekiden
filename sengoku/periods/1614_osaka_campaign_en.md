# 🏯 1614 — Siege of Osaka: The Last Stand of the Toyotomi Clan

## 📘 Scenario Background

Even after stepping down as *Shogun*, **Tokugawa Ieyasu** retained real power.  
Eventually, he raised an army under the pretext of “subduing the Toyotomi.”

His target was **Osaka Castle**, where **Toyotomi Hideyori** and his loyal retainers had fortified themselves.  
In response, the Toyotomi faction gathered rōnin from across Japan and prepared to resist Tokugawa’s domination.

A formidable fortification—**Sanada Maru**—was constructed, resembling the tactics of modern warfare.  
This was not just a defensive siege.  
It marked the final spark of the Sengoku Era and the fate of the Toyotomi legacy.
