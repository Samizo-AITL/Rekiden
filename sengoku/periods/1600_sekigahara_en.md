# ⚔️ 1600: Battle of Sekigahara — The Clash That Divided the Realm

---

## 📘 Scenario Background

After the death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Japan's fragile peace began to crumble.  
Tokugawa Ieyasu, breaking prior oaths with his fellow lords, gradually seized de facto control.  
In opposition, **Ishida Mitsunari** raised arms under the banner of righteousness and formed the Western Army.

Thus began the **Battle of Sekigahara** — a conflict that would decide the fate of the nation.  
Though it was settled in a single day in real history, what if others had made different choices?

In this scenario, you can choose from **multiple factions**, and experience your own **"What if?" Sekigahara**.
