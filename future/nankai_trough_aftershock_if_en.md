# 🌊 Memory of the Trench – Rebuilding Japan (If)

## 📘 Overview

- **Time Setting**: 203X, after the Nankai Trough Megaquake
- **Playable Roles**: Japanese Government, Governors, Disaster Agency Chief, AITL-H Recovery AI Team
- **Goal**: Restore, rebuild, and redesign Japan’s future society
- **Structure**: Multi-ending based on choices—technology, diplomacy, citizen response

---

## 🎮 Turn 1: Immediate Response (Day 1–7)

**Situation**:
- A massive quake strikes the Nankai Trough. Coastal cities devastated. Tsunamis, fires, and aftershocks ongoing.
- Tokyo disabled. Kansai and Tokai regions see widespread collapse.

**Choices**:
1. Deploy AITL-H and JSDF for search, rescue, and transport
2. Request international aid (ASEAN, UN, others)
3. Use drones and AI to map isolated regions

---

## 🎮 Turn 2: Rebuilding Decisions (1 Month Later)

**Choices**:
1. Institutionalize drone logistics & disaster AI mapping
2. Launch regional self-governance models using AITL-H
3. Hold national vote on “New Japanese Archipelago Plan”

---

## 🎮 Final Turn: End of 203X

**Outcomes (If Routes)**:
- Distributed Resilience Model succeeds → AI-assisted autonomous regions spread
- Rushed rebuild leaves Japan unprepared for second wave → catastrophic collapse
- "New Federal Japan" gains public support → semi-autonomous AI-governed society begins
