# 🏯 Intro to the Sengoku Period – Japan’s Age of Warring States

Welcome to the Sengoku Period (戦国時代) – Japan’s “Age of Warring States.”  
If you’re new to Japanese history, this guide will help you understand the people, conflicts, and shifting powers behind **Rekiden**.

## ⏳ What Was the Sengoku Period?

- **Timeframe**: 1467 – 1615 (about 150 years)
- **Meaning**: "Sengoku" = Warring States — Japan fell into civil war
- **Background**:
  - Central authority collapsed (Ashikaga shogunate weakened)
  - Regional lords (*daimyo*) rose to power and fought for dominance
  - Frequent betrayals, shifting alliances, and deadly battles
  - Ultimately unified by the Three Great Unifiers

## 👑 The Three Great Unifiers

| Name | Role | Known For |
|------|------|-----------|
| **Oda Nobunaga** | Ruthless revolutionary | Crushed Buddhist armies, used firearms, defeated Imagawa |
| **Toyotomi Hideyoshi** | Strategic genius | Rose from peasant to ruler, carried out unification |
| **Tokugawa Ieyasu** | Patient tactician | Won the Battle of Sekigahara and established the shogunate |

These figures play major roles in many Rekiden scenarios — as leaders, allies, or enemies.

## ⚔️ Core Themes in Sengoku Strategy

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Betrayal** | Alliances were fragile; trust was rare |
| **Military Innovation** | Guns (tanegashima), pike formations, siege tactics |
| **Clans and Castles** | Power came from territory, rice production, and strongholds |
| **Upstarts vs Elites** | Low-born men like Hideyoshi rose to rule through cunning |
